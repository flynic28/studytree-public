This Privacy Policy describes our practices with information that we (or our service providers) collect through our websites, smartphone applications, tablet applications, and other network-connected products and services (collectively, the “<u>Platform</u>”). This Privacy Policy only addresses information collected directly through or from our Platform – it does not address or govern any information-gathering, use, or dissemination practices related to information collected from you other than directly through or from the Platform, such as from telephone, facsimile, postal mail, personal delivery, or other or additional offline means or media.</p>

        <p>By providing Personal Information to StudyTree or by using the Platform, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p>If you have any questions concerning this Privacy Policy or wish to exercise your rights as described in this Privacy Policy, please email us at privacy@studytreeapp.com.</p>

        <p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>INFORMATION COLLECTION </strong></p>

        <p><strong>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Information You Provide</strong></p>

        <p>Some elements of the Platform may ask you to submit Personal Information in order for you to benefit from the specified features or to participate in a particular activity. For example, we may request Personal Information from you when you create an account. You will be informed what information is required to utilize these features of the Platform, and what information is optional. Certain aspects of the Platform may allow you to post or otherwise submit photos, videos, graphics, information, comments, and other content to publicly available sections of the Platform. Upon submission, all such content may become publicly available and may be viewed, read, collected, or used by others outside of our control.</p>

        <p>We may combine the information you submit through the Platform with other information we have collected from you, whether on- or offline. We may also combine it with information we receive about you from other sources, including publicly available information sources (such as publicly available social media profiles) as well as our service partners and data licensors, all subject to applicable laws.</p>

        <p><strong>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Student Data</strong></p>

        <p>StudyTree uses the Platform to integrate academic support services of higher education institutions with artificial intelligence to provide students with a mobile academic assistant. Accordingly, some of the Personal Information that you submit may be subject to certain laws and regulations governing student data (that information is referred to herein as “<u>Student Data</u>”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, we will at all times comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and all other applicable laws. We consider your Student Data to be strictly confidential and will not use your Student Data for any purpose other than improving the Platform and providing our services to you and your higher education institution(s).</p>

In those cases where we may request or invite you to provide the foregoing information, we will only do so with your express consent, in accordance with applicable data protection law requirements. Where you provide us with such information without request from StudyTree to this end, we reserve the right to erase any such information at our discretion.</p>

        <p><strong>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Information Related to Minors</strong></p>

        <p>The Platform is not intended for persons under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information online from persons in this age group. We reserve the right to delete any information identified as having been provided by such persons at our discretion.</p>

        <p><strong>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Passive Information Collection, Use, and Choices</strong></p>

        <p>As you navigate the Platform, certain Personal Information may be passively collected, meaning it is gathered without your actively providing it. This is done using the following technologies in the following ways:</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Through your browser</strong>: Certain information is collected by most browsers, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type, operating system type, version screen resolution, and Internet browser type and version.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Through your device</strong>: If you access the Platform through a mobile device or other network-connected product, certain information may be collected about that device, including your device type, network service provider, and other identifiers. We may collect unique device identifiers (such as IDFA and AID tags and UUID and UDID identifiers) associated with the device you use to access the Platform.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Using cookies</strong>: Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer you are using. Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Platform, pages visited, and language preferences. We and our service providers use this information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience while using the Platform. More specifically, we use cookies to:</p>

        <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recognize your computer or device to make your use of the Platform easier, such as to remember your locations of interest and other preferences with the Platform;</p>

        <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gather statistical information about use of the Platform in order to continually improve its design and functionality, understand how individuals use it, and to assist us with resolving questions regarding it;</p>

        <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the Platform and on other websites, applications, and online services that you use; and</p>

        <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Track consumer responses to online advertisements. To learn more about cookies, please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org"><u>http://www.allaboutcookies.org</u></a>.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Using Monitoring Tools</strong>: The Platform may utilize pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, Flash Shared Objects, HTML5 Local Storage, HTML5 Mini Databases, and other similar technologies, both on certain aspects of the Platform and in HTML-formatted e-mail messages to you. These monitoring tools are used for the purpose of, among other things, measuring the success of our marketing campaigns, compiling statistics about Plaftorm usage and response rates, and tracking the activities of users of the Platform and e-mail recipients.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>IP Address</strong>: Your IP Address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider. An IP Address is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits the Platform, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many online service providers, including website operators. We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating Platform usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Platform.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Analytic Tools</strong>: We may also use tools and third party services to collect information about usage of the Platform, including Google Analytics. You can learn more about Google Analytics, and its privacy practices, at the Google Analytics <a href="http://insite/generalwiki/Pages/IT%20Support.aspx"><u>Help Page</u></a>. Generally speaking, Google Analytics collects information on how often users visit the Platform, what aspects of the Platform they visit when they do so, and what other websites users visited prior to accessing the Platform. The Platform makes use of Google Analytics services for Demographics and Interest Reporting as well as Display Advertising features, including Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, and DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration. You may opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads through the <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated?hl=en"><u>Google Ads Settings page</u></a>. You may also prevent your data from being collected and used by Google Analytics by opting out through the use of the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/"><u>Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</u></a>.</p>

        <p>If you are uncomfortable with the idea of your Personal Information being collected and used in these ways, most computer systems, devices, and web browsers offer privacy settings and options, such as disabling cookies, resetting your IDFA, turning off location-based services, or opting for “Do Not Track” features. See Section 2(c) below for more information on opting out of Interest-Based Advertising. We do not override these settings or options and encourage you to use them to enhance your choices and personalize your experiences. However, in order to access certain content, features, services, products, or benefits of the Platform, you may be required to provide us with certain information. If you do not wish to provide that information through the Platform or if you opt to utilize the aforementioned privacy features, you may be unable to obtain certain content, features, services, products, or benefits of the Platform. Changing these settings will not prevent you from seeing advertisements and offers, but those advertisements and offers may not be tailored to your interests and needs.</p>
