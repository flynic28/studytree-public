            <p><strong>Last Updated: 8/9/17</strong></p>
      
            <p>Welcome to the StudyTree platform (the “<u>Platform</u>”). The Platform is operated by StudyTree, Inc.

            <p><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
      
            <p>IN NO EVENT WILL STUDYTREE BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OTHER THAN ACTUAL AND DIRECT DAMAGES PROVEN IN A COURT OF LAW. IN NO EVENT SHALL STUDYTREE’S LIABILITY EXCEED THE PRICE YOU (EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH YOUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION) PAID FOR THE SERVICE THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE CLAIM. IF ANY PART OF THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS FOUND TO BE INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON, THEN THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF STUDYTREE AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT EXCEED TEN DOLLARS.</p>
      
            <p>Without limiting the foregoing, you understand and acknowledge that StudyTree shall not be liable to you for:</p>
      
            <p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary losses which may be incurred by you arising out of your use of, or inability to use, the Platform or the Services, including any loss of profit (whether incurred directly or indirectly), any loss of goodwill or business reputation, or any loss of data suffered by you; or</p>
      
            <p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any loss or damage which may be incurred by you as a result of: (1) any reliance placed by you on the completeness, accuracy, or existence of any information or materials made available through the Platform, including any advertising; (2) any relationship or transaction between you and any advertiser or sponsor whose advertising appears on the Platform or the Services; (3) any changes that StudyTree may make to the Platform or Services, or for any permanent or temporary cessation in the provision of the Services (or any features within the Services); (4) the deletion of, corruption of, unauthorized access to, or failure to store, any content and other communications data maintained or transmitted by or through your use of the Platform or the Services; (5) the use of any products or services obtained on or through the Platform; or (6) any other matter relating to the Platform, the Services, the Platform Content, or the User Content.</p>
      
            <p>The limitations on StudyTree’s liability to you in this Section 7 shall apply whether or not StudyTree has been advised of or should have been aware of the possibility of any such losses arising.</p>
      
            <p>IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THE PLATFORM, THE SERVICES, OR THESE TERMS, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE PLATFORM AND SERVICES.</p>
      
            <p><strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Indemnity</strong></p>
      
            <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless StudyTree, its officers, directors, members, employees, agents, affiliates, licensors and suppliers, from and against all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorneys’ fees) arising from: (a) your use of and access to the Platform and Services; (b) your violation of any of these Terms, including the Privacy Policy; (c) your violation of any third party rights, including intellectual property or privacy rights; and (d) the use by of the Platform by any person using your Internet account or account login. This defense and indemnification obligation will survive these Terms and your use of the Platform and Services. StudyTree reserves the right, at StudyTree’s own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you hereunder, and you shall cooperate in all reasonable respects in such defense. You may not settle any claim contemplated in this Section 8 without the prior written consent of StudyTree.</p>
      
            <p><strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Links To and Features Provided by Third Parties</strong></p>
      
            <p><strong>T</strong>he Platform may contain links to other websites or feature services of third parties for the convenience of users: (a) in locating information, products, or services that may be of interest; or (b) with performing or receiving the Services, and complying with any requirements associated with such transactions. These third party websites and services may be available on the Platform via a link, redirect, plug-in, integrated application, or other technology, and may be recognized automatically by your browser.</p>
      
            <p>In order to utilize some aspects of the Platform and Services, you may have to use, accept, install, and review information, data, executables, programs, software, and other items from StudyTree’s third party service providers, suppliers, and licensors. To the extent applicable, these Terms shall apply, but please be aware that StudyTree has no control over these third parties, and that these Terms may not apply to such links and services. StudyTree does not recommend and expressly disclaims any responsibility for the content, the accuracy of the information, or quality of products or services provided by or advertised on third party websites or the transactions you conduct or enter into with third parties. Your use of any third party websites or services is at your own risk, and subject to the terms and conditions of such third parties. StudyTree encourages you to read the privacy policies and terms of use linked or referenced in the websites you enter.</p>
      
            <p><strong>10.&nbsp; </strong><strong>Infringement Complaint Procedures</strong></p>
      
            <p>If you believe that any content or postings on the Platform violates your intellectual property or other rights, please notify StudyTree (via the methods described in the preamble to these Terms) with a comprehensive detailed message setting forth the following information: (a) your name and the name of your company, if any; (b) your contact information, including your email address; (c) the nature and substance of your complaint, the specific rights at issue, and your basis for making the complaint, including the content or posting that is objectionable; and (d) the following statement: “The statements, representations, and assertions made in this message are true, complete, and accurate and I have the full legal authority to make each and every such statement, representation, and assertion and to make and be granted any demand made in this message.”</p>
      
            <p><strong>11.&nbsp; </strong><strong>Dispute Resolution</strong></p>
      
            <p>Any dispute arising out of these Terms shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the “<u>AAA</u>”). Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual; and an arbitrator must also follow the terms of these Terms, as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability and the scope or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide. Arbitration shall take place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, unless StudyTree elects otherwise.</p>
      
            <p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different StudyTree users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same StudyTree user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, StudyTree will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by StudyTree should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your demand for arbitration and StudyTree will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. If the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of accessing arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of accessing a court for purposes of pursuing litigation on an individual basis, StudyTree will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the costs of accessing arbitration from being prohibitive. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse StudyTree for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by StudyTree on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA’s rules. If an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this agreement to arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this agreement to arbitrate shall still apply.</p>
      
            <p>You can choose to reject this agreement to arbitrate by mailing StudyTree a written opt-out notice (“<u>Opt-Out Notice</u>”). The Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than thirty days after the date you accept these Terms for the first time. You must complete the Opt-Out Notice form by providing the information called for in the form, including your name, address (including street number and address, city, state, and zip code), phone number, and the email address used to log in to the StudyTree account to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the agreement to arbitrate. If you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply. Opting out of this agreement to arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with StudyTree.</p>
      
            <p><strong>12.&nbsp; </strong><strong>Operation of the Platform and United States Law</strong></p>
      
            <p>The Platform is controlled and operated from within the United States. Without limiting anything else, StudyTree makes no representation that the Platform, Platform Content, User Content, services, products, information, or other materials available on, in, or through the Platform is appropriate or available for use outside the United States, and access to them from territories where they are illegal is prohibited. Those who choose to access the Platform from outside the United States do so on their own will and are responsible for compliance with applicable laws.</p>
      
            <p>The Platform may only be used in compliance with applicable statutes or regulations relating to the export control laws and regulations of the United States, and any amendment thereof. The Platform, the Platform Content, and all underlying information and technology licensed hereunder shall not be accessed, downloaded, used, possessed, or otherwise exported or re-exported to (or to a national or resident of) any country outside of the United States without first complying strictly and fully with all export controls and other applicable laws that may be imposed by the United States Government or any country or organization of nations within whose jurisdiction you use the Platform, the Platform Content, or any underlying information or technology.</p>
      
            <p><strong>13.&nbsp; </strong><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>
      
            <p>These Terms, including the Privacy Policy, constitute the entire legal agreement between you and StudyTree regarding the Platform and govern your use of the Platform, Services, and any transactions you may have with StudyTree through the Platform. These Terms completely replace and supersedes any prior agreement or understanding, arrangement, undertaking, or proposal, written or oral, between you and StudyTree regarding these matters. In the event any other rule, code of conduct, or other matter posted on the Platform conflicts with the terms of these Terms, these Terms shall govern. No oral explanation or oral information given by any party shall alter the interpretation of these Terms.</p>
      
            <p>You understand that StudyTree may make changes to these Terms from time to time. Your continued use of the Platform following the posting of changes to these Terms will be considered your consent to those changes. When these changes are made, StudyTree will make a new copy of the Terms available on the Platform. You agree that StudyTree is under no obligation to provide you with notices regarding changes to these Terms. You understand that it is your responsibility to check the Terms regularly for changes.</p>
      
            <p>You agree that any failure or delay of StudyTree to exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy contained in or made available by these Terms (or that StudyTree has the benefit of under any applicable law) will not be taken to be a formal waiver of StudyTree’s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to StudyTree. If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide a matter arising out of these Terms, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from these Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms and the remaining provisions will continue to be valid and enforceable.</p>
